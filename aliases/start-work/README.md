# Start Work GitHub CLI Alias

A GitHub CLI alias that helps streamline the process of starting work on a new task by automating branch creation and pull request setup.

## Installation

This alias is installed automatically when you run the installation script: 

```bash
./scripts/install-aliases.sh
```

## Usage

```bash
gh start-work <JIRA_TICKET> [ISSUE_TYPE]
```

### Arguments

- `JIRA_TICKET` (Required): The Jira ticket number/ID that this work relates to
- `ISSUE_TYPE` (Optional): Type of issue you're working on. Defaults to "feat"
  - Valid values:
    - `feat`: new feature for the user
    - `fix`: bug fix for the user
    - `refactor`: code refactoring (e.g. renaming a variable)
    - `chore`: anything else (build tasks, documentation, style, etc.)

### Options

- `--help`: Display help information about the command

### Examples

```bash
# Start work on a feature
gh start-work PROJ-123

```

## What it does

When you run this command, it will:

1. Create a new branch named `<ISSUE_TYPE>/<JIRA_TICKET>`
2. Append a new section to `.changes.md` with the branch name as the title
3. Commit the updated `.changes.md` file
4. Push the branch to the remote repository
5. Create a pull request in DRAFT state with:
   - Title: Branch name
   - Body: "Work started on <branch_name>"
   - Base branch: main

## Prerequisites
